				<p>Amenhotep II (sometimes called Amenophis II and meaning 'Amun is Satisfied') was the seventh pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. Amenhotep inherited a vast kingdom from his father Thutmose III, and held it by means of a few military campaigns in Syria; however, he fought much less than his father, and his reign saw the effective cessation of hostilities between Egypt and Mitanni, the major kingdoms vying for power in Syria. His reign is usually dated from 1427 to 1401 BC. His consort was Tiaa, who was barred from any prestige until Amenhotep's son, Thutmose IV, came into power. </p>

				<p>Nofret's parents are not known. Nofret married Prince Rahotep, a son of Pharaoh Sneferu. She had three daughters and three sons with Rahotep.[
					Nofret was buried with her husband in mastaba 6 at Meidum.[2] In 1871 by Daninos, beautiful statues of Rahotep and Nofret were found.[3] Nofret is depicted with a black wig and very fair face. Her titles in hieroglyphs on the back of her chair name her as "King's Acquaintance".[4] The statues are now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.[5] The mastaba of the couple had two burial chambers and two cult chapels. The Southern cult chapel belonged to Rahotep, the northern one to Nofret. Here she is depicted with Rahotep in front of an offering table. The inscription over the scene provides a second title for her: miteret (translation still not known today).[6] </p>

				<p>Granodiorite is felsic to intermediate in composition. It is the intrusive igneous equivalent of the extrusive igneous dacite. It contains a large amount of sodium (Na) and calcium (Ca) rich plagioclase, potassium feldspar, quartz, and minor amounts of muscovite mica as the lighter colored mineral components. Biotite and amphiboles often in the form of hornblende are more abundant in granodiorite than in granite, giving it a more distinct two-toned or overall darker appearance. Mica may be present in well-formed hexagonal crystals, and hornblende may appear as needle-like crystals. Minor amounts of oxide minerals such as magnetite, ilmenite, and ulvöspinel, as well as some sulfide minerals may also be present.</p>

A debauched Habsburg Prince sends out one of his aide-de-camps to bring him back a gypsy girl. The film was considered as an attack on the aristocracy.[1] It was made by Korda for the state-owned film industry during the Hungarian Soviet Republic.
